**Project Name**

CPU Simulator



**Purpose**

This is the class project of Computer Architecture to help understanding what was happened under the basement of the computer system (In the instruction level).



**Programming Language and Library**

Using java and java swing for the GUI. 



**How to use** 

Download the JAR file and load the instructions to run.





**What kind of function does this application implemented.**



- Implementing a memory and cache.
-  Executing LOAD and STORE instructions.
-  Building initial user interface to simulator.
- Designing and implementing the modules for floating point and vector operations.
- The complier to complier the pseudo instruction to the machine code.
- A friendly and neat user interface to operate this application.



What I learned from this project ?

- The CPU's structure design and application analysis is very important before start coding, try to draw a flow chart to simulate the whole process of the application.
- For the reusability and the maintenance, the instruction part and UI part should followed the rules of objected orientated programming. (Use the extension of the class and design interfaces)
- The Java swing is out dated and need do more than other new library (javafx).
