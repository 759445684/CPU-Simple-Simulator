# CSCI6461 computer architecture

Designing and implementing a simple computer simulator.

Fall 2017

The George Washington University

In this project, we design and implement a simple computer simulator. This project has 4 components. And, these components will be implemented during the semester.

## Component 1: Basic Machine

We are working on designing and implementing the basic machine architecture in this phase. In particular:
- Implementing a simple memory.
- Executing LOAD and STORE instructions.
- Building initial user interface to simulator.

## Component 2: Memory and Cache Design
- Designing and implementing the modules for enhanced memory and cache operations.
- Implementing all instructions except for MSR, CHK, and Floating Point/Vector operations.
- Extending the user interface.
- Demonstrate 1st program running on our simulator.

## Component 3: Execute All Instructions
- Handling machine faults and TRAP.
- Extending the user interface
- Demonstrate 2nd program running on our simulator.

## Component 4: Floating point and vector operations
- Designing and implementing the modules for floating point and vector operations.
